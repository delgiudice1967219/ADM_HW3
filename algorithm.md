### Pseudocode

The intuition is that, starting from the origin (0, 0) in the first quadrant where all packages are located, the first package is always reachable. Given that we can only move up or right, we can only reach packages that are above or to the right of the current one. Therefore, for each package reached, we need to check the next one: if it is below or to the left, we can print "NO" because it’s unreachable. Otherwise, we proceed, but to ensure the lexicographically smallest path, we need to sort all packages in ascending order by their coordinates.

Below is the pseudocode of an algorithm that solves this problem:

$ \mathbf{PackageCollector(t)} $

(0) $ \textbf{for text case t}: $

* (1) $ read(n) $

* (2) $ \text{packages} ← \text{[ ]} $

* (3) $ \textbf{for i=1 to n:} $ // $O(n)$

 * (4) $ read(x[i]), read(y[i]) $
 * (5) $ \text{packages} \leftarrow \text{packages} + [(x[i], y[i])] $
* (6) $ \textbf{Sort} \text{ packages by x and then y coordinate in ascending order}$ // $ O(n \log(n)) $
* (7) $ \text{x_current} \leftarrow 0 $
* (8) $ \text{y_current} \leftarrow 0 $
* (9) $ \text{path } \leftarrow \text{' '}$
* (10) $ \text{possible} \leftarrow \text{TRUE} $

* (11) $\textbf{for i=1 to n:} $ // $O(n)$

  * (12) $ \textbf{if } \mathbf{x[i]<}\textbf{x_current or } \mathbf{y[i]<}\textbf{y_current:} $
    * (13) $ \text{possible} \leftarrow \text{FALSE} $
    * (14) $ break $
  * $ \textbf{end if} $
  * (15) $ \text{num_right_moves} \leftarrow x[i]-\text{x_current} $
  * (16) $ \text{num_up_moves} \leftarrow y[i]-\text{y_current} $
  * (17) $ \text{path} \leftarrow \text{path} + \text{'R'} \cdot \text{num_right_moves} $
  * (18) $ \text{path} \leftarrow \text{path} + \text{'U'} \cdot \text{num_up_moves} $
  * (19) $ \text{x_current} \leftarrow x[i]$
  * (20) $ \text{y_current} \leftarrow y[i]$
* $ \textbf{end for} $
* (21) $ \textbf{if possible:} $
    * (22) $ output(\text{'YES'}) $
    * (23) $ output(\text{path}) $
* $ \textbf{end if} $
* (24) $ \textbf{else:} $
  * (25) $ output(\text{'NO'}) $

$ \textbf{end for} $

### Proof of Correctness

The algorithm aims to determine a path from the origin $(0,0)$ to each package coordinate $(x[i],y[i])$, using only right and up movements. We will show that the algorithm checks when such a path is possible, and, if it is, how to build a valid sequence of right ```R``` and up ```U``` movements to visit all the target locations in order.

The algorithm works on a set of inputs whose general structure is known. It first reads the number $n$ of packages (1), and then their coordinates (4).

Since the robot can move right and up, similar to a staircase, it is able to reach any package that is in the first quadrant of the moving reference system centered in the current robot's cell. To do this, the robot just needs to move the number of steps to the right that it takes to reach the package's x coordinate, and move up for a number of steps corresponding to the difference in y coordinates between robot and package.

Every time there is at least one package in the robot's top-right quadrant, the algorithm must make sure that the robot does not skip packages, if it is avoidable. Otherwise, it might erroneously conclude that there is no path to reach all the packages. The sorting (6) ensures that the sequence of coordinates is non-decreasing in the x- and y-axes, and the robot visits them in the natural order tailored to its freedom of movement.

Step (12) evaluates whether the next package in the sequence is reachable by the robot. If only one of the coordinates of the next package in line is smaller than the robot's current position coordinates, the algorithm assigns a ```False``` value to the variable ```possible``` and later prints 'NO' in (25).

If all package coordinates are reachable in the sorted order, the algorithm constructs the path as follows:
   - For each package coordinate $(x[i], y[i])$, add `R` repeated $ x[i] - \text{x_current} $ times to move to the right (15)
   - Then, add `U` repeated $ y[i] - \text{y_current} $ times to move upward (16)

This process continues for all packages until a complete path is generated from $(0, 0)$ to the final destination.

The algorithm correctly identifies and implements a path when it exists because of the sorting step (6), the validity check in (12) and the path construction steps in (15)-(18). These passages enable the robot to traverse the grid and collect packages without backtracking.

On the other hand, if a path through all the package coordinates does not exist, this fact will emerge from the check (12). It can happen when, for example, the next package in the sequence is close in x coordinate and high in the y coordinate, but a later package that is next in the x coordinate, has a lower y coordinate. This is because we prioritized horizontal coordinates over vertical ones. Thanks to (12), the algorithm will detect cases like these.

**Termination**: The loop iterates through all $n$ packages exactly once, and each reachable package updates ```x_current``` and ```y_current``` without backtracking. Therefore, the algorithm terminates after a finite umber of steps.

**Correct Path**: If the algorithm outputs 'YES' and a path, then all packages are reachable following the non-decreasing sequence of ```x``` and ```y``` coordinates. The resulting path ensures each package is visited in sorted order.

**Verifying Existence**: If a path crossing all the packages starting from $(0,0)$ and moving only right and up does not exist, the algorithm detects it in the validity check and outputs 'NO'.

### Algorithm Complexity

Let us look at the algorithm step by step and calculate its complexity.

* The algorithm starts with a loop over the test cases (0), so it is executed $t$ times. Therefore, the total running time of the algorithm will be the running time of the operations inside this for loop, times $t$
* Afterwards, the algorithm reads $n$, the number of packages (1), and initializes the variable $\text{packages}$ where the package coordinates will be stored (2). These two operations take constant time $O(1)$
* Next, we find a for loop (3) that is executed $n$ times, once for each package whose coordinates need to be read. Reading the coordinates $x[i]$ and $y[i]$ happens in (4), then the coordinates are added to the $\text{packages}$ array (5). Both (4) and (5) require constant time, and since the for loop is called $n$ times, for a single test case this segment will cost $O(n)$.
* Step (6) sorts the package locations by x and y coordinates. This means that the coordinates are primarily sorted by their first entry, and if two locations have the same x coordinate, they will be sorted by their second coordinate. In the worst case, sorting will take $O(2 \cdot n \log(n))$, which is equivalent to $O(n \log(n))$.
* Steps (7) and (8) initialize the coordinates of the robot's current location, which initially is $(0,0)$, in $O(1)$ time
* Step (9) initializes the $\text{path}$ string ($O(1)$) where the moves of the robot will be saved, and step (10) initializes a boolean variable $\text{possible}$ ($O(1)$), 'True' by default, which will be converted to 'False' in case it is not possible to construct the path through all the packages
* After this, we have another for loop (11) that iterates over the coordinates in the $packages$ array and is executed at most $n$ times.
* The for loop begins with an if loop (12) that checks if the coordinates $x[i]$ and $y[i]$ are out of reach for the robot from its current position. If they are reachable, the algorithm ignores the operations in the if cycle and continues to build the path. If the coordinates are not reachable, the $\text{possible}$ variable is set to 'False' in (13) ($O(1)$) and the algorithm exits the for loop over the packages (14) ($O(1)$).
* In case the coordinate validity check is positive, the algorithm continues to execute lines (15) to (20). Here, it first calculates how many steps the robot has to move right and up to reach the next package ((15) and (16), $O(1)$), then updates the $\text{path}$ variable to include the new right and up moves ((17) and (18), $O(1)$). Finally, the current position of the robot is set to the current package's coordinates ((19) and (20), $O(1)$). All these operations together require twelve steps, considering addition, multiplication and assignement, so they all take constant time $O(1)$.
* This concludes the for loop starting at (11), which executes constant operations at least $n$ times. Therefore, this loop costs $O(n)$ time in total.
* At the end, we have an if loop (21) that checks if the $\text{possible}$ variable is true. If yes, it prints 'YES' (22) and the previously computed $\text{path}$ (23), requiring constant time $O(1)$. In case $\text{possible}$ is False, an else block (24) is triggered, printing 'NO' (25). 

Putting all of this together, we get a worst-case total running time of $O(n\log(n) + n)$ for each test case. Since $n\log(n)$ is asymptotically stronger than $n$, we can rewrite this in big-O notation as $O(n\log(n))$. This is the complexity for one test case. Considering all $t$ test cases, we get $O(t \cdot n\log(n))$. The most expensive part is the sorting step at (6), and all other segments are at most linear.

### LLM Complexity Evaluation

Here is the complexity analysis of the algorithm provided by the LLM ChatGPT:

### Step-by-Step Analysis of Time Complexity

#### 1. Input Reading and Initialization (Steps 1-2):
- Reading $n$ takes $O(1)$.
- Initializing the `packages` list takes $O(1)$.

#### 2. Reading Package Coordinates (Steps 3-5):
- The loop runs $n$ times, and in each iteration:
  - Reading $x[i]$ and $y[i]$ takes $O(1)$.
  - Adding a tuple to the list takes $O(1)$.
- **Total for this loop**: $O(n)$.

#### 3. Sorting the Packages (Step 6):
- Sorting $n$ elements based on two keys takes $O(n \log n)$.

#### 4. Path Construction and Validation (Steps 11-20):
- The loop runs $n$ times, and in each iteration:
  - Comparing $x[i]$ and $y[i]$ with `x_current` and `y_current` takes $O(1)$ (Step 12).
  - Updating the `path` string involves concatenating strings for right and up moves. Let $k$ represent the total number of moves across all packages. Since $k \leq n$ in the worst case:
    - Adding characters to the string takes $O(k)$ in total.
  - Updating `x_current` and `y_current` takes $O(1)$.
- **Total for this loop**: $O(n)$.

#### 5. Output Result (Steps 21-25):
- Printing "YES" or "NO" and the path involves $O(n)$ for the path string output in the worst case.

### Per Test Case Complexity:
Summing the complexities for a single test case:
- Reading input: $O(n)$
- Sorting: $O(n \log n)$
- Path construction: $O(n)$
- Outputs: $O(n)$

Thus, the total complexity for a single test case is:
$ O(n + n \log n + n) = O(n \log n)$

### Accounting for $t$ Test Cases:
With $t$ test cases, the above steps are repeated $t$ times. Therefore, the total complexity is: $O(t \cdot n \log n)$

### Final Time Complexity:
$O(t \cdot n \log n)$

Both our analysis and the one provided by the LLM reach the same conclusion. The analysis is accurate because we are evaluating the worst-case running times in big-O notations for each test case, and then multiplying them by the number of test cases $t$. For each test case, we have: 

$O(1)$ (read $n$ and initialize $\text{packages}$) $+ O(n)$ (read $2\cdot n$ coordinates) $+O(n\log(n))$ (sort coordinates) $+O(n)$ (for loop over coordinates with internal constant time operations) $+O(1)$ (final if-else block to print results) $=O(n\log(n))$

For $t$ test cases, this becomes $O(t \cdot n\log(n))$
